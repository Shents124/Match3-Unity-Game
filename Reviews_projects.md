# Advantages of the project’s design and organization

Clear directory structure

The variable names are set according to common conventions

Classes are relatively easy to read and understand

# Disadvantages of the project’s design and organizatio

Using a lot of Reference Type Casting

Creating and destroying game objects continuously instead of reusing them 

Strong dependencies between different Class making it difficult to modify or maintain them independently


# Suggestion 

Embrace polymorphism and interface-based programming to reduce the need for explicit casting

Using Object Pooling Pattern to improve game performance

Apply SOLID principles and Design patterns for easy maintenance and scalability
